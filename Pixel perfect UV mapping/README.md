# Pixel perfect UV mapping

## Instructions:

Open the *Operator search dialog* (Space bar) and type *Map the mesh with pixel perfect size*, then you can set your desired pixels per unit and the texture size. The only thing left for you to do is to place the UVs correctly, this addon **only handles the size of your UVs** (Don't try to place your UVs first because everytime this script gets called, it will make all the UV mapping from scratch, **overwriting everything**)

I recommend using [Snap to pixel](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/editors/uv_image/uv/editing/layout.html?#uv-options) so the layout sits perfectly on pixels
